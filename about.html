<div class="about">
    <h2>ALL History</h2>
    <p>ALL was founded in the Fall of 2003 and held its first monthly meeting in January of 2004. With the help of its members, sponsors, and patrons, ALL fosters and celebrates creativity and artistic expression in Lowell and the surrounding areas.</p> 
    <p>It is the mission of the Arts League of Lowell to be a community of artists of all expressions, to encourage mutual support, facilitate the sharing of knowledge, and provide a unified voice for the arts.</p>
    <p>In a city whose motto is "Art is the handmaid of human good" the Arts League of Lowell has become the catalyst for the creation of a community of all artists. Through ALL, longtime residents and Lowell's new cultural immigrants can come together to share ideas and resources, and to promote each others' work.</p>
